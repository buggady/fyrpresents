          <!-- Some Text -->
          <p>&emsp;Have you ever been to Burning Man? You walk around the Playa and see people dressed in crazy outfits (or not dressed at all), singing, dancing, hanging off of moving structures, basically being insanely fun. You think, “These people are crazy! I wonder what they do for a living,” and then you find out they’re a VP at Apple or Google or they run some other billion-dollar company. <br>&emsp; We somewhat see ourselves in the same light. We party hard, and we party often, but in the day-to-day we’re all highly-functioning, hard-working adults with real jobs. We come together in good times and bad; we support each other in times of need; we celebrate one another’s accomplishments, and we work together to exceed expectations with every new challenge. <br> &emsp;Back in 2014, a few people from various cities in Texas met at TomorrowWorld. They thought, “Hey, you seem cool. Let’s get together again.” They rented three connecting houses on some land out in Nacogdoches and invited other friends they also thought were cool. This wonderful group of people came together for one of those weekends they make movies about. Thus the creation of FYR. <br>&emsp; Over the last few years, our group has expanded and so have our talents. We have some amazing DJs amidst our organization. We started planning parties, which became larger-scale events as our crew grew and so did the friends invited. Need help planning an event? We have that. Need PR, Marketing, Advertising or Social Media? Got that too. Need something a little more technical or digital? Check and check. We can even cover your mental and/or physical therapy needs. <br>&emsp; If you’re not looking for our services but just want to make a bunch of really great friends, check out our events page! We always welcome kind, responsible, open-minded people into our group! But if you are the opposite of any of those things, there is another group out there for you. *Note: rude=not OK, sarcasm=OK. Feel free to <a href="https://fyrpresents.com/contact"><strong>contact us</strong></a> if you have any questions!  <br><br></p>

                <div class="panel-body"><p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Like most any boring tale, FYR’s founding originated with 7 savages in the wilderness of TomorrowWorld 2014. After the festival ended, the savages dispersed to their separate Texas towns. Having been apart for a long while, these 7 barbarians discussed meeting back up again for some festivities. So, they reached out to their chums   to see if they cared to partake in some dancing, drinks, and entertainment. They watched as their guest list grew and grew, they simply did not have enough resources to accommodate all their companions, the event was hopeless. Astounded, they pondered long and hard about how they could host everyone. They would need the assistance of all their guests to make this celebration a success.<br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;All attendees worked tirelessly and offered everything they could spare – money, decorations, music, food, spirits – the support poured in. They researched and researched for a site to accommodate everyone and found the perfect place. Everything was coming together perfectly; excitement and anticipation rose through all the guests. Until the worst had happened, one week before the party, the landowner begrudgingly sent notice to the party, “You never told me you were having a party and therefore you are not allowed to have your celebrations on my domain, I will be keeping your money for the trouble you gave me, BYE!” The hosts were enraged when receiving this news, as well as fearful the party was ruined and their money lost.<br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Once again, the guests united their resources to resolve the issue at hand. Some pleaded with the landowner, some used intellectual comprehension, while others rapidly would seek out a new location to host the celebration. At last, the landowner became fearful and gave the money back and the seekers found a new site. Despite all the troublesome complication, everyone was ecstatic to finally arrive at the party. Everyone enjoyed the stress free weekend relaxing, dancing, playing music, eating food, and challenging each other to drinking games. To conclude this saga, all guests became best of friends, vowing to always return to their annual reunion. </p></div>
